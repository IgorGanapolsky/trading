from src.strategies.youtube_strategy import YouTubeStrategy

async def analyze_market_videos():
    strategy = YouTubeStrategy(
        openrouter_api_key=os.getenv("OPENROUTER_API_KEY")
    )

    # Monitor daily market analysis videos
    videos = [
        "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...",  # Bloomberg
        "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...",  # CNBC
    ]

    results = await strategy.analyze_video_list(videos)

    # Get high-confidence signals
    signals = [
        s for s in results['aggregated_signals']
        if s['confidence'] >= 0.8
    ]

    # Feed into trading decision engine

## Cost Analysis

| Component | Setup Cost | Ongoing Cost |
|-----------|------------|--------------|
| youtube-transcript-api | $0 | $0 |
| yt-dlp | $0 | $0 |
| LLM Analysis | $0 | ~$0.01-0.10/video |
| MCP Server | $0 | $0 |

**Total**: Essentially free (only LLM analysis, which uses your existing OpenRouter credits)

---

## Performance Expectations

### Speed
- Metadata extraction: 1-2 seconds per video
- Transcript download: 2-3 seconds per video
- AI analysis: 10-30 seconds per video (parallel LLM queries)
- Total: ~15-35 seconds per video

### Accuracy
- Transcript extraction: 95%+ (for clear audio)
- Sentiment analysis: 70-85% (ensemble of 3 LLMs)
- Signal quality: Requires validation (never trade on YouTube alone)

### Scalability
- Can process 10-20 videos per batch
- Daily monitoring: 5-10 videos recommended
- Weekly deep dive: 20-50 videos feasible

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- YouTube API changes → Use yt-dlp (actively maintained)
- Missing transcripts → Fallback to manual review
- LLM errors → Use ensemble of 3 models + error handling

### Trading Risks
- Bad signals → Require confidence >0.8, cross-validate
- Outdated info → Prioritize recent videos (<48 hours)
- Manipulation → Validate with multiple sources
- Overreliance → Use as ONE signal among many

---

## Success Metrics to Track

1. **Coverage**: % of target videos analyzed (target: >80%)
2. **Timeliness**: Time from publish to analysis (target: <30 min)
3. **Signal Quality**: Accuracy of high-confidence signals (target: >60%)
4. **Integration**: % of YouTube signals that influence trades (target: 20-30%)
5. **Performance**: P&L from YouTube-informed trades
