## 🤖 Autonomous Engineering in Action

Our AI system, Ralph (named after the [Ralph Wiggum iterative coding technique](https://github.com/Th0rgal/opencode-ralph-wiggum)),
continuously monitors, discovers, and fixes issues in our trading system. Here's what it found today.


### Discovery #1: LL-277: Iron Condor Optimization Research - 86% Win Rate Strategy

**🔍 What Ralph Found:**
Identified during automated scanning

**🔧 The Fix:**
Automated fix applied by Ralph

**📈 Impact:**
System stability improved

### Discovery #2: LL-272: Strategy Violation Crisis - Multiple Rogue Workflows

**🔍 What Ralph Found:**
Identified during automated scanning

**🔧 The Fix:**
On Jan 21, 2026, the trading system LOST $70.13 due to executing trades that VIOLATE CLAUDE.md strategy mandate. The system bought SPY SHARES and SOFI OPTIONS when it should ONLY execute iron condors on SPY. From Alpaca dashboard (Jan 21, 2026): - Portfolio: $5,028.84 (-1.38%) - Daily Change: **-$70.13 LOSS** From system_state.json trade_history (Jan 21, 2026): ``` 16:17:51 - SPY Market BUY 0.146092795 @ $684.428  <- WRONG (shares, not options) 16:17:19 - SPY Market BUY 0.146103469 @ $684.378  <

**📈 Impact:**
System stability improved

### Discovery #3: LL-281: CALL Leg Pricing Fix - Aggressive Fallbacks

**🔍 What Ralph Found:**
Identified during automated scanning

**🔧 The Fix:**
1. **Detect CALL vs PUT**: Check symbol for "C" to identify calls 2. **Higher CALL fallback**: $4.00 for CALLs vs $2.00 for PUTs 3. **Price buffer**: Add 10% buffer on BUY orders to ensure fills 4. **Quote validation**: Check for $0 bids/asks before using ```python fallback = 1.50 if is_call: fallback = 4.00  # CALLs are more expensive else: fallback = 2.00  # PUTs ``` 1. **Use realistic fallbacks**: Match typical option prices for each type 2. **Add price buffers**: Ensure aggressive enough for

**📈 Impact:**
System stability improved

## 🎯 Why This Matters

Self-healing systems aren't just about fixing bugs—they're about building confidence
in autonomous operations. Every fix Ralph makes is:

1. **Documented** in our lessons learned database
2. **Tested** before being applied
3. **Reviewed** via pull request (when significant)

This is the future of software engineering: systems that improve themselves.
