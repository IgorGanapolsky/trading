## 🤖 Autonomous Engineering in Action

Our AI system, Ralph (named after the [Ralph Wiggum iterative coding technique](https://github.com/Th0rgal/opencode-ralph-wiggum)),
continuously monitors, discovers, and fixes issues in our trading system. Here's what it found today.


### Discovery #1: LL-277: Iron Condor Optimization Research - 86% Win Rate Strategy

**🔍 What Ralph Found:**
Identified during automated scanning

**🔧 The Fix:**
Automated fix applied by Ralph

**📈 Impact:**
System stability improved

### Discovery #2: LL-298: Invalid Option Strikes Causing CALL Legs to Fail

**🔍 What Ralph Found:**
Identified during automated scanning

**🔧 The Fix:**
- Added `round_to_5()` function to `calculate_strikes()` - All strikes now rounded to nearest $5 multiple - Commit: `8b3e411` (PR pending merge) 1. Always round SPY strikes to $5 increments 2. Verify ALL 4 legs fill before considering trade complete 3. Add validation that option symbols exist before submitting orders 4. Log when any leg fails to fill - LL-297: Incomplete iron condor crisis (PUT-only positions) - LL-281: CALL leg pricing fallback iron_condor, options, strikes, call_legs, validati

**📈 Impact:**
System stability improved

### Discovery #3: LL-272: PDT Protection Blocks SOFI Position Close

**🔍 What Ralph Found:**
Identified during automated scanning

**🔧 The Fix:**
**Option 1**: Wait for a day trade to fall off (5 business days from oldest day trade) **Option 2**: Deposit funds to reach $25K (removes PDT restriction) **Option 3**: Accept the loss and let the option expire worthless (Feb 13, 2026) 1. **Check day trade count BEFORE opening positions** - query Alpaca API for day trade status 2. **Never open non-SPY positions** - this was the original violation 3. **Close positions on different days from opening** - avoid same-day round trips 4. **Track day tr

**📈 Impact:**

## 🎯 Why This Matters

Self-healing systems aren't just about fixing bugs—they're about building confidence
in autonomous operations. Every fix Ralph makes is:

1. **Documented** in our lessons learned database
2. **Tested** before being applied
3. **Reviewed** via pull request (when significant)

This is the future of software engineering: systems that improve themselves.
