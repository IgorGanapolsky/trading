## Risk Management Strategy

### Circuit Breakers (Automatic Trading Halt)
1. **Daily Loss >2%**: Halt for remainder of day
2. **Weekly Loss >5%**: Halt for remainder of week
3. **Max Drawdown >10%**: Halt indefinitely, manual review required
4. **3 Consecutive Losses**: Reduce position sizes by 50%

### Position Management
1. **Maximum position size**: 10% of portfolio
2. **Maximum sector allocation**: 30% of portfolio
3. **Stop-loss**: 5% (Tier 1), 3% (Tier 2)
4. **Take-profit**: 10% (Tier 2)
5. **Maximum holding period**: 90 days (force review)

### Capital Allocation Adjustments
Review monthly and adjust if:
- Strategy consistently underperforming (<5% annually)
- Strategy outperforming (>20% annually) - consider increasing allocation
- Risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe ratio) below threshold
