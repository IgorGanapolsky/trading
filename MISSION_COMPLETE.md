## 💾 MEMORY SYSTEM

### How We Track EVERYTHING

**Layer 1: Real-Time State**
- File: `data/system_state.json`
- Contains: Account, trades, performance, heuristics, notes
- Updates: After every execution
- Survives: Reboots, crashes, power loss

**Layer 2: Daily Trade Logs**
- Files: `data/trades_YYYY-MM-DD.json`
- Contains: Individual trade details per day
- Purpose: Complete audit trail

**Layer 3: Performance History**

### After Reboot

**You can ask me**:
- "What's my current P/L?"
- "How many trades have we done?"
- "What's our best ETF?"
- "Show me day 15 performance"

**I'll load**:
```python
from state_manager import StateManager
sm = StateManager()
context = sm.export_for_context()
# Full system state loaded
```

**Everything persists. Nothing is lost.**

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES

### Market Reality
- **Orders placed today** will execute at market open tomorrow
- **System runs weekdays only** (markets closed Sat/Sun)
- **Paper trading = zero risk**
- **Real money = real risk** (only after 90 days validation)

### OpenRouter AI
- **Currently not working** (model availability issue)
- **System works WITHOUT AI** (technical analysis sufficient)
- **Can add AI later** when credits are sorted
- **Not a blocker** for profitability

### Expectations
- **30 days is short** - Real validation needs 90 days
- **Expect volatility** - Some days up, some down
- **Goal is learning** - Not instant riches
- **Compound interest takes time** - Be patient
